# Workflow

## Where things live

Napkins live in `30-napkins/` and never move. That's the canonical path — all references point there. Status is tracked separately via symlinks in `40-board/`.

```
30-napkins/
  0100-feature/          ← canonical, never moves
    0100-feature.nap.md
    0100-feature.spec.md
    0100-feature.journeys.md
    0100-feature.test.md
    agents/
      001-test-arch-feature/
        prompt.md
        response.md
      002-fs-eng-feature/
        prompt.md
        response.md
      003-test-eng-feature/
        prompt.md
        response.md

40-board/
  10-draft/
  20-backlog/
  30-todo/
  40-doing/
    0100-feature → ../../30-napkins/0100-feature   (symlink)
  50-review/
  60-done/
```

## Status transitions

Moving a symlink IS the status change. The canonical path never breaks.

```bash
# napkin shaped, ready for backlog
ln -s ../../30-napkins/0100-feature 40-board/20-backlog/0100-feature

# scheduled for implementation
rm 40-board/20-backlog/0100-feature
ln -s ../../30-napkins/0100-feature 40-board/30-todo/0100-feature

# agents launched
rm 40-board/30-todo/0100-feature
ln -s ../../30-napkins/0100-feature 40-board/40-doing/0100-feature

# agents done, ready for review
rm 40-board/40-doing/0100-feature
ln -s ../../30-napkins/0100-feature 40-board/50-review/0100-feature

# human approves
rm 40-board/50-review/0100-feature
ln -s ../../30-napkins/0100-feature 40-board/60-done/0100-feature
```

**Who moves symlinks:** the architect, as part of the workflow. When SQLite lands (M1), the app automates this.

## The happy path

### 1. Napkin → spec (architect + human)

Architect reads the napkin. Writes:
- `NNNN-feature.spec.md` — min spec, only constraints the implementer can't derive
- `NNNN-feature.journeys.md` — concrete developer/user journeys

### 2. Spec → test architecture (test-architect agent)

Test architect reads spec + journeys. Writes:
- `NNNN-feature.test.md` — strategic test cases focused on integration seams

Launched by architect via `nap start`. Gets its own context window.

### 3. Code (fullstack-eng agent)

Reads spec + test.md. Writes code shaped so the tests are possible — proper APIs, module boundaries, injectable dependencies.

### 4. Tests (test-eng agent)

Reads test.md + the code. Writes actual test code. Runs it. Reports failures.

### 5. Iterate

Test eng reports failures → fullstack eng fixes → test eng re-runs. Loop until green.

## Launching agents

Every agent is a full Claude Code session in its own terminal. Not a subagent buried inside another session. The human can click on any agent in the sidebar, watch it work, talk to it, invoke skills — full Claude Code capabilities.

Each agent gets a directory inside the napkin:

```
30-napkins/0100-feature/agents/
  001-test-arch-feature/
    prompt.md          ← architect writes
    response.md        ← agent writes when done
```

Architect launches via NAP CLI:

```bash
nap start 'claude --verbose "read .nap/.../001-test-arch-feature/prompt.md and write your response to .nap/.../001-test-arch-feature/response.md"' --name 001-test-arch-feature
```

This spawns a real Claude Code session in a real terminal. The agent appears in the sidebar with a green dot. The human can click it and watch it think.

Architect waits:

```bash
nap nap 001-test-arch-feature --timeout 300
```

Blocks until agent signals completion. Then architect reads `response.md`.

**Critical:** agents must call `nap done` when finished. They won't do it automatically — the prompt must tell them explicitly.

## The prompt.md contract

Every prompt.md is self-contained. It includes:
- Role (or path to role file)
- What to read (exact file paths)
- What to produce
- Where to write output

If you handed this prompt to a stranger with access to the repo, they could do the job.

**Every prompt must end with this, verbatim:**

```
CRITICAL: when you are done, write your response to <path>/response.md, then run `nap done` in your terminal. The architect is blocked waiting — without this, the pipeline stalls.
```

Last line of the prompt. Every time. Agents forget if it's buried in the middle.

## Agent communication

- **Files:** prompt.md (architect → agent), response.md (agent → architect)
- **NAP CLI:** `nap poke` (send message), `nap nap` (wait for completion), `nap done` (signal done)
- **Questions:** agent writes to `questions.md`, calls `nap done` with a message. Architect reads, updates spec or answers, re-launches.

## Failure flow

Test eng reports failure → architect decides:
- Code bug? Route to fullstack eng.
- Spec problem? Update spec, re-run from step 3.
- Test wrong? Update test.md, re-run test eng.
