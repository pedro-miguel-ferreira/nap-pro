## Key principles

- **Napkins never move.** `30-napkins/0100-feature/` is the canonical path. All references point there.
- **Status lives in symlinks.** `40-board/` dirs contain symlinks back to `30-napkins/`. Moving a symlink = status change.
- **Filesystem is the source of truth for content.** Human edits napkins, specs, prompts in their editor.
- **When SQLite lands**, it becomes source of truth for status. Symlinks stay as editor lenses.

## Nepic structure

Each nepic is one milestone/era of the project:
- `10-docs/` — mega napkin, milestones, handoffs
- `15-feedback/` — bugs and wishlist (living docs, anyone can append)
- `20-architects/` — `001-architect/`, `002-architect/`, etc.
- `30-napkins/` — canonical napkin dirs
- `40-board/` — symlinked status dirs

## Feature numbering

4 digits, spaced by 100:

```
0100, 0200, 0300, ...
```

Room for 99 insertions between each (0101-0199).

## Agent numbering

3 digits within a feature directory:

```
001-role-subject
```

Role and subject in the name:
- `001-test-arch-sqlite` — test architect for SQLite
- `002-fs-eng-sqlite` — fullstack engineer for SQLite
- `003-test-eng-sqlite` — test engineer for SQLite

## File extensions

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.nap.md` | Napkin — compressed idea anchors |
| `.spec.md` | Min spec — why, what, constraints the implementer can't derive |
| `.journeys.md` | Developer/user journeys |
| `.test.md` | Test architecture — strategic test cases |
